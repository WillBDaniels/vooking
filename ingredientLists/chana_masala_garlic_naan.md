Alright everyone, there's a tie between the Bao Buns and the Chana Masala, so I'll go ahead and tie-break thtat and say that we're going to do the Chana Masala. Largely for ease of cooking this first time, and it requires no special tools, which is nice, only :sparkles:  **spice** :sparkles: . Here is the full ingredient list, but a few awesome things about this to keep in mind. 
1. it's inherently vegan and gluten free, I'll post in a bit about the naan recipe, which can also be modified for vg/gf if needed.
2. if you're missing some of the more exotic spices, it will **still taste delicious**. Now, I will say, the more of the 'special' spices (fenugreek, green cardamom, amchoor, etc.) the **better** it will taste, but there are only truly a few essentials. I'll make notes of which ones you really can't do without, and what you can sub if you don't want to spend money on spices you don't use a ton. 

 *   **2 tbsp coconut oil or vegetable oil** (cocount oil is a bit high in fat, so although it adds flavor, the added fat isn't worth it to me personally)
 *   **1 1/2 yellow onions**, finely diced (2 cups) (white onion is fine too, red onion would probably taste odd)
 *   **4 cloves garlic, minced**
 *   **1 tsp minced ginger (~1/2" piece)** (ginger paste would be a fine substitute. Ginger powder would work in a pinch, but you'd lose a lot of the aromatic nature here)
 *   **4 whole dried red chiles**, more or less to taste (honestly, I recommend just grabbing these, they come in a cheap bag from King Soopers, just any red dried chili will work, don't stress to much on the variety. If you really don't want to, chili flakes can sub in a pinch, but you'll have to taste test more often for your desired spiciness.)
 *   **2 green cardamon pods** (can be omitted if too expensive/you don't want. However they last forever if you buy em, and add much deliciousness)
 *   **2 whole cloves** (pretty necessary. Ground cloves can be used in a pinch)
 *   **1 cinnamon stick** (necessary, but ground cinammon can be used in a pinch... carefully. easy to overdo it with ground)
 *   **1 bay leaf** (necessary)
 *   **1 tsp amchoor (dried mango powder)** (this is **not** necessary, but makes the Chana Masal 'authentic'. YMMV, up to you.)
 *   **1 tsp ground coriander**
 *   **1/2 tsp ground cayenne or hot chili powder**
 *   **1/2 tsp garam masala** (necessary. once this is in your pantry, all of the sudden every recipe online you find will need it. It's bizarre.)
 *   **1/4 tsp turmeric** (necessary)
 *   **freshly ground black pepper**
 *   **1 to 1 1/2 tsp salt to taste**
 *   **3 cups (28oz can) cooked chickpeas, drained and rinsed**
 *   **26oz can strained, crushed, or pur√©ed tomatoes**
 *   **1 1/2 tsp kasoori methi, optional** (this is also known as fenugreek leaves, or fenugreek seeds. Fenugreek seeds are now one of my favorite spices to use, it gives food a wonderful roasted, nutty flavor that's hard to describe. They're pricey, but if you can stomach it, a very nice addition. I've only ever used the seeds, not the leaves, so....)
 *   **minced cilantro, for garnish**
 *   **minced yellow onion, for garnish**


 If I didn't makes special note of something it's because I thought it was common and didn't need it, and is needed for the recipe. let me know if you have any questions, and I'll follow up shortly with the NaaN bread ingredients!
