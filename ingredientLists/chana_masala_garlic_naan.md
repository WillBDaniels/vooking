### Chana Masala Ingredients

 *   **2 tbsp coconut oil or vegetable oil** (cocount oil is a bit high in fat, so although it adds flavor, the added fat isn't worth it to me personally)
 *   **1 1/2 yellow onions**, finely diced (2 cups) (white onion is fine too, red onion would probably taste odd)
 *   **4 cloves garlic, minced**
 *   **1 tsp minced ginger (~1/2" piece)** (ginger paste would be a fine substitute. Ginger powder would work in a pinch, but you'd lose a lot of the aromatic nature here)
 *   **4 whole dried red chiles**, more or less to taste (honestly, I recommend just grabbing these, they come in a cheap bag from King Soopers, just any red dried chili will work, don't stress to much on the variety. If you really don't want to, chili flakes can sub in a pinch, but you'll have to taste test more often for your desired spiciness.)
 *   **2 green cardamon pods** (can be omitted if too expensive/you don't want. However they last forever if you buy em, and add much deliciousness)
 *   **2 whole cloves** (pretty necessary. Ground cloves can be used in a pinch)
 *   **1 cinnamon stick** (necessary, but ground cinammon can be used in a pinch... carefully. easy to overdo it with ground)
 *   **1 bay leaf** (necessary)
 *   **1 tsp amchoor (dried mango powder)** (this is **not** necessary, but makes the Chana Masal 'authentic'. YMMV, up to you.)
 *   **1 tsp ground coriander**
 *   **1/2 tsp ground cayenne or hot chili powder**
 *   **1/2 tsp garam masala** (necessary. once this is in your pantry, all of the sudden every recipe online you find will need it. It's bizarre.)
 *   **1/4 tsp turmeric** (necessary)
 *   **freshly ground black pepper**
 *   **1 to 1 1/2 tsp salt to taste**
 *   **3 cups (28oz can) cooked chickpeas, drained and rinsed**
 *   **26oz can strained, crushed, or pur√©ed tomatoes**
 *   **1 1/2 tsp kasoori methi, optional** (this is also known as fenugreek leaves, or fenugreek seeds. Fenugreek seeds are now one of my favorite spices to use, it gives food a wonderful roasted, nutty flavor that's hard to describe. They're pricey, but if you can stomach it, a very nice addition. I've only ever used the seeds, not the leaves, so....)
 *   **minced cilantro, for garnish**
 *   **minced yellow onion, for garnish**

### Garlic NaaN Ingredients. 

## With Yeast
This method will reqiure you start a bit before the class, so that everything times out correctly. I'll give you the full schedule later, but the tl;dr is that you need about 2 hours total to create 'the perfect NaaN'. What that means in practice is that you'll be starting the NaaN around 4 PM. Up to you!
Ingredient List: 
* White Flour (bleached or unbleached)
* salt
* sugar
* active dry yeast packet (the red bordered one from.. fleischmann? w/e)
* 1/3 cup milk
* plain yogurt or greek yogurt. 
* Vegetable Oil
* Garlic cloves
* Butter
* Cilantro
* More Garlic :sparkles:

## Without Yeast
* Flour
* Salt
* Baking Powder
* vegetable oil
* milk
* butter (for the topping)
* garlic
* cilantro

## Vegan With Yeast (reqiures rising)
* water
* active dry yeast
* sugar
* white flour
* salt
* baking powder
* garlic cloves
* diary-free yogurt (coconut works, COYO has one)
* vegetable oil
* cocounut oil/vegan butter for topping
* Garlic Cloves (more!)
* cilantro

This recipe I'm looking at [here](https://minimalistbaker.com/easy-vegan-naan/) doesn't specify why the rise is longer than in non-vegan alternatives. It's possible it takes the yeast a little longer to deal with the yogurt vs. milk? hard to say. YMMV, it might only take an hour/hour and a half to rise, could take 2-4 hours. Might wanna test this ahead of time. 

## Vegan, no Yeast
Follow the recipe up above and swap the milk for dairy free yogurt. that's it!


## Special Note
You can top the NaaN with... anything! pesto, mozzarella, cumin, I don't care! whatever you think is tasty. I'll be doing a buttery garlic with cilantro, but cooking is fun because it's flexible :).

 If I didn't makes special note of something it's because I thought it was common and didn't need it, and is needed for the recipe.
