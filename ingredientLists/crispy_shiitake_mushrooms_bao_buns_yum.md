## Homemade Bao Buns with Crisp soy-glazed Shiitake Mushrooms and picked veggie filling

### Ingredients
* active dry yeast (the red fleischmann (sp?) packet thingy)
* Flour
* Sugar
* Salt
* Baking Powder
* Rice vinegar (if you really don't want to get this, white wine, or simply white vinegar will do in a pinch, however rice vinegar does add a lot of nice flavor)
* Oil of some sort 
* 1 cucumber
* 1 Carrot
* 1 Jalepeno
* Soy Sauce
* Maple syrup (honestly, any thick liquid sweetener is fine here, honey, agave, ??? whatever. Please don't use really nice maple syrup, that stuff isn't for cooking with)
* Peanuts
* Scallions (green onions)
* fresh cilantro (unless you're one of those monsters that doesn't like cilantro. j/k, eat what you like, no judgement)
* Hoisin Sauce <-- aka: korean bbq sauce
* **Sambal Oelek** <- Alright, quick aside here. this stuff is more or less 'sriracha jelly' aka: sriracha with more spices, and WAY more deliciousness. I literally have a bulk-sized container of it in my closet I like it so much. Why even have sriracha if I have this? Sriracha is so boring now. Anyway, if ALL you have is sriracha and you don't want to buy one-off ingredients because you hardly ever cook asian (namely chinese/japanese/korean) cuisine, it's fine, otherwise, just grab it, it's so damn good. 
* Sesame Oil <- Not strictly required, but adds a great flavor with only a little bit. 
* 1 pound of shiitake mushrooms. <- Pro-tip here, if you have an asian store near you, they'll sell these for WAY cheaper than any other store.
* **1 10-inch Bamboo Steamer** you can grab this at your local asian grocery store for hella cheap, or bed bath and beyond, or [here](https://www.amazon.com/Asian-Kitchen-Bamboo-Steamer-10-Inch/dp/B000OFNL8Y) on amazon prime. It's a great tool I find myself using a lot, which is neat. There are no easy workarounds if you don't have this, so lets mark this as required. 


## Hoisin sauce tip
If you don't want to buy hoisin, because you always end up with 1/2 -> 1/4 of the bottle left in your fridge for the next year (this is a real thing), just make it yourself! it's hella easy, and keeps for a while. You can see a good example of it [Here](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/hoisin-glazed-pork-chops). Just ignore the pork chop bit, the hoisin sauce is everything before step 3, there's even a nice little video that shows you how! neat.
